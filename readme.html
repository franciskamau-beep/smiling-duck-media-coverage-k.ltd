# Smiling Duck Media Coverage Ltd. — Website

A small static website for **Smiling Duck Media Coverage Ltd.** — ready to edit and run locally.

## Files included
- `index.html` — Home page (camera background, intro, canvas logo)
- `outlets.html` — Outlets in at least three major towns and working hours
- `bookings.html` — Online booking form (client-side demo)
- `gallery.html` — Animated gallery where images fly in B&W then colorize
- `styles.css` — Central stylesheet
- `script.js` — All JavaScript behaviors (canvas logo draw, cookies, greetings, gallery animation)
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- `.gitignore` — basic
- `README.md` — this file

## Features
- Canvas-generated smiling duck logo drawn programmatically (no external logo file required).
- Navigation across pages (Home, Outlets, Bookings, Gallery).
- Gallery animation: images fly in (appear B&W → then colorize).
- Cookie set for 1 year (named `sdm_visitor`).
- Page refresh every 60 seconds (meta and JS reload).
- Greeting function `greetings()` demonstrates local variable scope; wired to a button on the Home page that alerts "Hello client".
- All headings and paragraph text styled blue; background color white.
- Simple client-side booking form (demo only; no server).
- Keywords/meta-author included for repository.

## How to run locally
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Open `index.html` in the browser (right click → Open with Live Server or double-click the file).
   - If you use Live Server extension in VS Code, you'll get live reload on changes.
4. Navigate through pages by clicking the nav links.

## Deploying
- It's a static site — deploy easily:
  - GitHub Pages: push the repo to GitHub and enable Pages (branch `main` or `gh-pages`).
  - Netlify / Vercel: drag & drop the folder or connect the repo — automatic deployment.
  - Any static host (S3 + CloudFront, Surge, etc.) will work.

## Customization notes
- Replace gallery image URLs in `gallery.html` with your own generated images.
- Logo: to use an external PNG/SVG logo instead of the canvas, replace the `<canvas>` element with an `<img>` tag and adjust CSS.
- Booking: integrate server-side endpoint (POST) to process bookings; the form currently only shows a confirmation message.
- Cookie expiration is set to 365 days in `script.js`.

## Screenshots and badges (suggested)
- Add a README screenshot folder (`/screenshots`) with `home.png`, `gallery.png`.
- Add badges (build / license) at the top of README if deploying to GitHub.
